### Thank you all!

Many thanks to all the riot community and to all our users who have really helped us making the best decisions to improve this framework.
Special thanks go to [@rogueg](https://github.com/rogueg) for his great work on the riot source code and he is now part of the riot core team.
Thanks also to the other core contributors and collaborators for the hard work on this project you are awesome.

### What comes next?

[@tipiirai](https://github.com/tipiirai) is working on a brand new riot release experimenting new rendering strategies and big core improvements that will be part of riot@4.0.0

For the next releases we will mainly focus on improving the initial rendering performances [riot/2034](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues/2034). We will try to bring the compiler sourcemaps and a better support for hot modules replacement stay tuned!
