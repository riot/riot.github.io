- Numerous [bug fixes](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues/584)
- Special thanks to *[@GianlucaGuarini](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini)* for this release


## 2.0.14 *Apr 8, 2015*

- [Server side rendering](/guide/#server-side-rendering)
- [Bug fixes](https://github.com/riot/riot/compare/v2.0.13...v2.0.14)

## 2.0.13 *Mar 11, 2015*

- A large bug fix release consisting of [pull requests](https://github.com/riot/riot/compare/v2.0.12...v2.0.13) from the community only. Thank you!

## 2.0.12 *Mar 2, 2015*

- Support for [Scoped CSS](/guide/#scoped-css)
- Direct [access to nested tags](/api/#nested-tags) and their API via `tags` variable. For example: `tags.my_timer.clear()`
- The custom tags are now constructed on parse time and initialized on mount time. This is preliminary work for the upcoming [plugin system](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues/416) and allows plugins to do their thing before initialization as well.
- `--whitespace` compiler option to preserve newlines and whitespace on the generated output. Good with nested `pre` and `textarea` elements.
- Using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) for cross browser testing
- *WARNING* the deprecated `riot.mountTo` will be removed on the next release


## 2.0.11 *Feb 23, 2015*

- `riot.mount` now accepts the same parameters as `riot.mountTo`, which is now *deprecated*
- New `riot.mount(selector, tagName, opts)` allows you to mount a certain tag to any selection of HTML elements
- `riot.unmount` followed with `riot.mount` now correcly replaces the earlier tag
- Test suite v1. Expect this to grow in size and functionality. Thanks to [@GianlucaGuarini](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini)


## 2.0.10 *Feb 19, 2015*

- [Todo MVC example](https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_todo)
- Array items can be sorted and reordered and the view updates accordingly. Thanks to [@pakastin](https://github.com/pakastin)!

- Fix compiler to support custom brackets
- `this.update()` is no longer needed when defining tags manually with `riot.tag`. This method is now automatically called after an event handler is executed
- [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/riot/riot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)


## 2.0.9 *Feb 13, 2015*

- LiveScript support
- Ability to set `if`, `show` and `hide` attributes for a custom tag
- Multiple class shortcut: `{ 'foo bar': baz }`
- Took away `children` property, which was designed for theoretical need mostly.
- A memory leak fix on `riot.observable`. Thanks to [@GianlucaGuarini](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini) for the hard debug work and everyone else on this [pull request](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues/248)


## 2.0.8 *Feb 9, 2015*

- New `unmount()` method and `children[]` property for [tag instances](/api/#tag-instance)

- [Compiler API](/api/compiler/) exposed to the public
- Global variables are supported in expressions, e.g. `{ location }`

- [Customizable brackets](/api/misc/#brackets), e.g. `riot.settings.brackets = '${ }'`
- Ability to print the current version with: `riot --version`
- The semi-hidden `riot._tmpl()` is now completely hidden and not part of the global `riot` object
- Reorganized source code. The former big `view.js` is now split into [multiple files](https://github.com/riot/riot/tree/master/lib/browser/tag)


## 2.0.7 *Jan 29, 2015*

- Super fast [in-browser compilation](/guide/compile/) for: `<script type="riot/tag">`
- Built-in [Typescript support](/guide/compiler/#typescript)
- Ability to plug in a HTML pre-processor (along with JS processor)
- Built-in [Jade support](/guide/compiler/#jade)
- Ability to define [custom parsers](/api/#route-parser) for router.

- Allow definition of empty placeholder tags. Good on development phase.
- `riot.observable()` now returns a new observable when called without the argument
- Compiler is now called like this:


```
var riot = require('riot')
var js_string = riot.compile(tag_source_string)
```
